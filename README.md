# zstd2tar

## Description
This package is for my personal use but you can use it if you want. I didn't find authentic name for this package so I named it "zstd2tar" (zstd to tar).
I have a problem with "apt" and "apt-get" command when I try to install ".deb" files with zstd compression.  

So this app will convert the compressed file to ".tar.xz" and then I can install it.

## Installation

Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/chrys-elrak/debian-repack-zstd2tar/releases/download/beta/debian-repack-zstd2tar_1.0.0-beta_amd64.deb) and then run the following command:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i {package_name}.deb
```

## Note
This app requires some commands to be installed on your system:
- zstd
- ar
- dpkg (for installing the package)
